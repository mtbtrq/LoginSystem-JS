<h1>*Sigh*</h1>
<p>I am very exhausted by making so many projects like these, but programming and its possibilities still amuse me to this very day.</p>

<h3>How to run?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the <code>server</code> folder, and run <code>install_deps.bat</code> to install all the dependencies.</kli>
  <li>Then navigate to into the <code>src</code> folder</li>
  <li>Run <code>run.bat</code>, and it will start a express API server on <code>localhost:5000</code> (you can change this in config.json, but I suggest you don't, as you'll have to change the port manually in the other js files in the client directory aswell.)</li>
  <li>Go to the  <code>client</code> folder, and run index.html, by double clicking on it, or any other method.</li>
  <li>Enjoy :)</li>
</ul>
